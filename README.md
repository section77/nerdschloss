## Compiling for Rapsberry Pi

When on Raspberry Pi, simply run with default features:

```sh
cd backend/
cargo run
```

This includes the `hardware` feature to control the motor.

## Testing/developing on other machines

To execute on another machine without GPIO pins, compile without the `hardware` feature:

```sh
cd backend/
cargo run --no-default-features
```

A simulated motor will appear, that just shows output for open/close events on stdout and waits 5 seconds for each of these actions.
